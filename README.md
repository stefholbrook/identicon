## Installation

* Run `mix setup` to setup project and install dependencies
* In the project directory start an interactive shell `iex -S mix` and create your image by calling the the Identicon main function and passing the name you want to create an image for `Identicon.main("image_name")`.
* This will create a file in your project directory which you can now view. To open from the terminal, in the project directory enter `open image_name.png` or view one of the existing images in the project -- `open banana.png` or open `asdf.png`
